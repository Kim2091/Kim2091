## Tools I Recommend:
- [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer) - This is a very good tool for inferencing AI models, but also for general image and video processing. It has a LOT of features and is very easy to get started with
- [StaxRip](https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip) - Great video processing software that supports Avisynth and Vapoursynth

## My projects:
- [chaiNNer-Templates](https://github.com/Kim2091/chaiNNer-Templates) - My templates for the aformentioned tool chaiNNer. These are custom made chains to help you get started!
- [PBRify_Remix](https://github.com/Kim2091/PBRify_Remix) - My current main project. It's a set of upscalers and PBR generation models intended for use with RTX Remix. Trained exclusively on CC0 content!
- [helpful-scripts](https://github.com/Kim2091/helpful-scripts) - A set of scripts intended to assist with training image SR models
